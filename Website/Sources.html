                        No data needed to be cleaned as it was already in a presentable format when scraped. 
                        When scraping, certain information had to be omitted, which were information reagrding cruise ships and 
                        US territories. This information was taken out because it lies outside the scope of our focus.</p>

                      <p>Forecast data for the range of potential deaths from COVID-19 is available from the CDC at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html. 
                        This data is provided by state and shows predictions from different models for 1 to 4 weeks in the future.</p>
                      <p>Forecasts fall into one of three categories:
                        <p>•	The LANL model does not explicitly model the effects of individual social distancing measures but assumes 
                          that implemented interventions will continue to be upheld in the future resulting in decreased growth.</p>
                        <p>•	The IHME and MOBS_NEU models are conditional on existing social distancing measures continuing through 
                          the projected time−period.</p>
                        <p>•	The CU models make different assumptions about the effectiveness of current social distancing interventions.</p>  
                      <p>The forecast data was downloaded as a csv. The purpose of this dataset was for forecast data by state, date, and type of model. Data clean-up included:</p>
                        <p>•	Removing rows that aggregated data for the US as a whole</p>
                        <p>•	Removing rows with missing information</p>
                        <p>•	Renaming columns for clarity (target week end date to target end date, location name to state, point to actual)</p>
                        <p>•	Changing the date values from strings to datetime objects so comparisons and filtering can be done on the final data table</p>
